# HEROKU
- Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). You use the CLI to manage and scale your applications, provision add-ons, view your application logs, and run your application locally.
- The Heroku CLI requires Git, the popular version control system.
-  You use the CLI to manage and scale your applications, provision add-ons, view your application logs, and run your application locally.

## Prepare the App
To clone a local version of the sample application that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

1. git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
1. cd node-js-getting-started

You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.

### Deploy the App
1. Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.
    - heroku create
        a. Creating sharp-rain-871... done, stack is heroku-18
        b. http://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/sharp-rain-871.git
     Git remote heroku added
    - When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository.

1. Heroku generates a random name (in this case sharp-rain-871) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.
1. Now deploy your code:
    - git push heroku master

#### View logs
Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.

View information about your running app using one of the logging commands, heroku logs --tail:
  - heroku logs --tail
heroku logs --tail
  - Visit your application in the browser again, and you’ll see another log message generated.
  - Press Control+C to stop streaming the logs.

A Heroku app’s logs are aggregated from the output streams of all of its running processes, system components, and backing services. Heroku’s Logplex routes log streams from all of these diverse sources into a single channel, providing a foundation for comprehensive logging.

1. Runtime logs
    - Heroku aggregates the following categories of logs for a deployed app:

1. App logs - Logging output from the application itself. This includes logs generated by your app’s code and dependencies. (Filter: --source app)
1. System logs - Messages about actions taken by the Heroku platform infrastructure on behalf of your app, such as: restarting a crashed process, sleeping or waking a web dyno, or serving an error page due to a problem in your app. (Filter: --source heroku)
1. API logs - Messages about administrative actions taken by you and other developers working on your app, such as: deploying new code, scaling the process formation, or toggling maintenance mode. (Filter: --source app --dyno api)
1. Add-on logs - Messages from add-on services. See the add-on’s Dev Center article for details. (Filter varies by add-on)

1. Build logs
    - The logs that are generated while building and deploying your app are separate from the app’s runtime logs. Logs for both successful and unsuccessful builds are available from your app’s Activity tab in the Heroku Dashboard:

#### Deploy Your Blog to Heroku

We will use Node.js for our project. Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform. First of all, of course, you need to install it. You'd better check the download page for more details. I'll wait until you finish, so don't worry. Is it done? Great! Now you can create your first web server. And it will be one of the easiest tasks in your life.
