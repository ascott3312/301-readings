# EJS - Ejectable Variables

## What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" 
Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript. 

### Embedded Viewer API
The Embedded Viewer API lets you embed book content from Google Books directly in your web pages with JavaScript. It allows you to build your own user experience around book previews.

Adding book preview functionality to your site is relatively simple, though it does require some knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. The Developer's Guide explains how the API can be loaded using the Google AJAX loader and drawn into a particular container on your page.

#### Options
cache Compiled functions are cached, requires filename
filename Used by cache to key caches, and for includes
root Set project root for includes with an absolute path (e.g, /file.ejs). Can be array to try to resolve include from multiple directories.
views An array of paths to use when resolving includes with relative paths.
context Function execution context
compileDebug When false no debug instrumentation is compiled
client Returns standalone compiled function
delimiter
openDelimiter
closeDelimiter '/li>
debug Outputs generated function body
strict When set to `true`, generated function is in strict mode
_with Whether or not to use with() {} constructs. If false then the locals will be stored in the locals object. (Implies `--strict`)
localsName Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using with Defaults to locals
rmWhitespace Remove all safe-to-remove whitespace, including leading and trailing whitespace. It also enables a safer version of -%> line slurping for all scriptlet tags (it does not strip new lines of tags in the middle of a line).
escape The escaping function used with <%= construct. It is used in rendering and is .toString()ed in the generation of client functions. (By default escapes XML).
outputFunctionName Set to a string (e.g., 'echo' or 'print') for a function to print output inside scriptlet tags.
async When true, EJS will use an async function for rendering. (Depends on async/await support in the JS runtime.
#### Tags
<% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
<%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
<%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
<%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
<%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
<%% Outputs a literal '<%'
%> Plain ending tag
-%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
_%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it
